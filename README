Youtube Storage for Paperclip

This Application contains an implementation of a new storage for Paperclip, youtube is the new storage, sure it just for videos only.
By using this implementation you can upload the videos to youtube throw Paperclip.

Use the example:
- Download the project: $ git clone git://github.com/Dr-Click/youtube-storage-for-paperclip.git
- Update your youtube credential in "video.rb" file
- Get into application directory: $ cd youtube-storage-for-paperclip
- Install the missing gems: $ rake gems:install
- Database migration: $ rake db:migrate
- Start the server: $ ruby script/server
- Go to : http://localhost:3000/videos/new


Integrate with your application:
- Copy file "/config/initializers/youtube_storage.rb" to your application "initializers" folder, that file contains whole logic of youtube storage.
- Copy other needed implementations like "migration, video model, helpers" to your application

 
Notes:
- In "/config/initializers/youtube_storage.rb", in the method "youtube_direct_upload" there is a tag "<media:keywords></media:keywords>" to include video tags if exists.
- The uploading to youtube will take long time depending on file size, so i think you have to delay the uploading job using any delay solution for paperclip, no needs for special handling.
- You can check for the uploaded videos on youtube, click on "My Videos" from your menu after log-in on youtube.
- Some times you may have this exception "(Can't connect to Youtube)" in first request to youtube after server starts, I have no reason for this, but it should works fine in the second request.
